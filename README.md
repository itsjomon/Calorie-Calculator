A simple Java-based console application that calculates your daily calorie needs based on your age, gender, weight, height, and activity level using the **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** formula.

## Features

- Calculates **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)** using gender-specific formulas
- Adjusts calorie needs based on activity level:
  - Sedentary
  - Moderate
  - Active
- Validates all user inputs
- Easy-to-use console interface

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Java `Scanner` for input
- Command-line interface

```
Calorie Calculator
Enter your gender (M/F): M
Enter your age (in years): 21
Enter your weight (in kilograms): 70
Enter your height (in centimeters): 175
